# 🔧 GitHub Pages Deployment Fix - Quick Summary

## ❌ The Problem

GitHub Pages' default build system **doesn't support the Chirpy theme** because:
- It only works with Jekyll 3.x (Chirpy needs 4.3+)
- It only allows a limited set of "safe" themes
- Chirpy requires custom plugins that aren't allowed

**Error you saw:**
```
The jekyll-theme-chirpy theme could not be found.
```

---

## ✅ The Solution

Use **GitHub Actions** to build your site instead of GitHub Pages' default builder.

# GitHub Pages Setup Guide for Chirpy Theme

## 🚨 Why You Got the Error

GitHub Pages' default build process **only supports a limited set of themes** (like Minima, Cayman, etc.). The Chirpy theme requires:
- **Jekyll 4.3+** (GitHub Pages uses Jekyll 3.x)
- **Custom plugins** not available in GitHub Pages' safe mode
- **Modern Ruby gems** and dependencies

**Solution:** Use GitHub Actions to build and deploy your site instead!

---

## ✅ What I've Set Up

I've created the necessary files for GitHub Actions deployment:

1. **`.github/workflows/pages-deploy.yml`** - Custom build and deploy workflow
2. **`.nojekyll`** - Tells GitHub to skip its default Jekyll build
3. **Updated `Gemfile`** - Added html-proofer for testing

---

## 🔧 Required: Update GitHub Repository Settings

You need to change one setting in your GitHub repository:

### Steps:

1. **Go to your GitHub repository**: https://github.com/trinathpanda/trinathpanda.github.io

2. **Click on "Settings"** tab (top right)

3. **Click "Pages"** in the left sidebar

4. **Under "Build and deployment"**:
   - Find: **"Source"** dropdown
   - Change from: ~~"Deploy from a branch"~~
   - Change to: **"GitHub Actions"** ✅

5. **Save** (it should save automatically)

### Screenshot Guide:

```
Settings → Pages → Build and deployment
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Source: [GitHub Actions ▼]         │  ← Change to this
│         (not "Deploy from a branch")│
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 🚀 Deploy Your Site

Once you've updated the repository settings:

### 1. Commit and Push Your Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions workflow for Chirpy theme"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Watch the Build Process

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click the **"Actions"** tab
3. You'll see a workflow running: **"Build and Deploy"**
4. Click on it to watch the progress
5. It should complete in 2-3 minutes

### 3. Access Your Live Site

Once the workflow completes successfully:
- Your site will be live at: **https://trinathpanda.github.io**
- The Chirpy theme will be fully functional!

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If the workflow fails:

**Check the Actions tab** for error messages:

1. **Ruby/Bundle errors**: 
   - Usually auto-resolved by the workflow
   - GitHub Actions installs everything fresh

2. **Build errors**:
   - Check your `_config.yml` for syntax errors
   - Ensure all posts have valid front matter

3. **HTML Proofer errors**:
   - These are warnings about broken links
   - The site will still deploy
   - Fix them at your leisure

### View Build Logs:

```
GitHub Repo → Actions tab → Click on workflow run → Click on "build" job
```

## ✨ What Happens Now

Every time you push to `main` or `master` branch:

1. ✅ GitHub Actions automatically triggers
2. ✅ Installs Ruby 3.3 and all dependencies
3. ✅ Builds your Jekyll site with Chirpy theme
4. ✅ Runs HTML tests (optional)
5. ✅ Deploys to GitHub Pages
6. ✅ Your site updates in 2-3 minutes!

---

## 📋 Workflow Features

The workflow I created includes:

- ✅ **Automatic builds** on every push
- ✅ **Manual trigger** option (workflow_dispatch)
- ✅ **HTML validation** to catch broken links
- ✅ **Concurrent deployment protection** (only one deploy at a time)
- ✅ **Proper permissions** for GitHub Pages
- ✅ **Ruby 3.3** with bundler caching for faster builds

I’m **Trinath**, a Clinical Data Scientist specializing in **clinical research, statistical analysis, and data standards**.  
My expertise spans **CDISC standards (SDTM, ADaM, Dataset-JSON)**, with a strong focus on **data provenance, interoperability, and automation** in clinical research.  

Currently, I’m:  
- Building a **CDISC Dataset-JSON Converter Package** to streamline regulatory submissions.  
- Working on **real-world data lineage projects** using **FHIR, Define-XML, and ODM 2.0**.  
- Transitioning from **SAS to Python**, leveraging libraries like **Pandas, NumPy, and FastAPI** for scalable, reusable solutions.  

I share my knowledge through the **Dr.CliniData newsletter** and will soon launch a **YouTube channel** to educate the clinical research community on **data programming and statistical analysis**.  

My mission is to:  
- Improve **healthcare data quality and interoperability**.  
- Build **reusable, well-documented components** for clinical data workflows.
